This is a drawing game where you can create the environment where this little monster lives.  
Team members: Bruno, Di, Victoria. The code for this sketch was completed by me alone (Di).  

The main technical points of this project, aside from the assignment's requirements, include the use of the `constrain` function, uploading an image, and switching colors using buttons (storing and defining RGB values).  
My favorite part is that you can press "enter" to save your drawing as an image, which adds interactivity to the project.  

The idea for this project came from the fact that both my teammates and I didn't draw the monster's habitat background, only the background itself. But I wanted to add something interactive, so I created this coloring game.  

Although I'm not entirely sure why, I have a feeling it might be some kind of sea monster, so I drew its environment this way.
